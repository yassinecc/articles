# Setting up Stripe on React Native/NodeJS

Stripe is a payment SaaS (Software As A Service) that has gained popularity due to its ease of use for developers and its turnkey handling of PCI compliance. It provides not only a simple way to implement payments on web and mobile, but also fraud detection mechanisms. We are going to see how to implement Stripe credit card payments from the ground up in React Native using the tipsi-stripe library.

### How does it work?

Credit card data is very sensitive information so you won't be handling card numbers and the sort! Instead, you are going to use Stripe objects:

- A **charge** is a transaction record for an amount to be debited from a given credit card. Stripe has implemented a two-step payment flow by allowing users to create uncaptured charges, where Stripe checks with your bank if there are sufficient funds available to carry the transaction and requests to put in on hold for an upcoming payment, and then capturing them which amounts to debiting your account.

{% hint style='info' %}

The biggest advantage of uncaptured charges is that you are guaranteed payment as the bank has confirmed availability of the funds, but you can also instantly release an uncaptured charge instead of waiting 3~5 days for a refund. Note that Stripe charges a fee for captured charges and refunds but releasing an uncaptured charge is free.

- A **customer** is the holder of one or multiple means of payment. 

- A **token**: this is essentially a representation of your credit card with its information encoded by Stripe using your publishable key. It can only be used once and will be disabled after payment is done.

- A **source** is another representation of your card that can generate recurring payments. It can only be generated by your secret key or directly in the Stripe dashboard.

### What you need to get started

- Create your account on www.stripe.com. In the `Developer` tab, you will see two API keys: a publishable one for your frontend and a secret one for your backend.

{% hint style='info' %}

You can share your publishable key with confidence as it can only create card tokenss. On the other hand, the secret key will handle sensitive operations such as payment, refunds and so on. Store it securely in your server and avoid if possible committing it in versioned source code.

{% endhint %}

- A React Native mobile app

- A backend server. We will use Node in this example but bear in mind that Stripe supports a variety of widely used languages such as Python, PHP, Java and .NET.


### Preparing the backend

In the directory where your `package.json` is located, install the node package provided by Stripe:

```
yarn add stripe
```

The idea is to expose a POST route that will handle payment on the server side. Let's declare a payment route in our Express server:

```code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

const stripeSecretKey = require('./secret.json').stripeSecretKey;

const stripe = require('stripe')($STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

app.post('/api/doPayment/', (req, res) => {
  stripe.charges.create({
    amount: req.body.amount, // Unit: cents
    currency: 'eur',
    capture: true,
    source: req.body.tokenId,
  });
});
```

The amount to charge is specified in cents for payments in currencies that don't have an irreductible unit, i.e. you can divide a euro in 100 cents. Replace `$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` with the secret key you can view on https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers/apikeys. As mentioned before, a better practice is to import the secret key from an untracked file.

Go to THIS STRIPE PAGE to generate a Stripe token with your publishable key, and then try out your route with Postman:

### Preparing the front end

There are two options at this point:

- Use the iOS / Android SDKs provided by Stripe
- Use a 3rd party library for React Native: `tipsi-stripe`

There are pros and cons to each path, mainly revolving around the fact that the React Native library from Tipsi has not been publicly approved by Stripe, although you can see into its source code that it does act as a wrapper around Stripe's mobile SDKs. There are rumours going around about Stripe possibly releasing its own official React Native module, however this has not been confirmed. In the rest of this tutorial we are going to use the `tipsi-stripe` library.

Navigate to your app's root directory and install the package:

```
yarn add tipsi-stripe
```

Let us now create a basic payment page, `payment.js`:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import stripe from 'tipsi-stripe';

stripe.init({
  publishableKey: '$YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
});

class Payment extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      isPaymentPending: false,
    };
  }

  requestPayment = () => {
    this.setState({ isPaymentPending: true });
    return stripe.paymentRequestWithCardForm()
      .then((stripeTokenInfo) => {
        console.warn('Token created', { stripeTokenInfo });
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.warn('Payment failed', { error });
      })
      .finally(() => {
        this.setState({ isPaymentPending: false });
      });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Button
          title="Make a payment"
          onPress={this.requestPayment}
          disabled={this.state.isPaymentPending}
        >
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```

{% hint style='check %}

You can now generate tokens with your own publishable key, and you will be the only one able to create a charge from this token with your secret key.

{% endhint %}

We will now connect our front-end and our backend. I like to group all my API calls in a separate `api.js` file:

```
import axios from 'axios';

export const doPayment = (amount, tokenId, accessToken) => {
  const body = {
    amount: amount,
    tokenId: tokenId,
  };
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  };
  return axios
    .post('http://localhost:5000/api/doPayment', body, { headers })
    .then(({ data }) => {
      return data;
    })
    .catch(error => {
      return Promise.reject('Error in making payment', error);
    });
};
```

I used here the axios library that directly rejects the fetch promise if it has a 40X status. Now we can change the `requestPayment` callback in `payment.js`:

```
requestPayment = () => {
    this.setState({ isPaymentPending: true });
    return stripe.paymentRequestWithCardForm()
      .then(stripeTokenInfo => {
        return doPayment(100, stripeTokenInfo.tokenId)
      })
      .then(() => {
        console.warn('Payment suceeded!')
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.warn('Payment failed', { error });
      })
      .finally(() => {
        this.setState({ isPaymentPending: false });
      });
  }
```

You should now see your first 1â‚¬ payment on the Stripe dashboard
