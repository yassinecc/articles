# Setting up Stripe on React Native/NodeJS

Stripe is a payment SaaS (Software As A Service) that has gained popularity due to its ease of use for developers and its turnkey handling of PCI compliance. It provides not only a simple way to implement payments on web and mobile, but also fraud detection mechanisms. We are going to see how to implement Stripe credit card payments from the ground up in React Native using the tipsi-stripe library.

### How does it work?

Credit card data is very sensitive information so you won't be handling card numbers and the sort! Instead, you are going to use Stripe objects:

- A **charge** is a transaction record for an amount to be debited from a given credit card. Stripe has implemented a two-step payment flow by allowing users to create uncaptured charges, where Stripe checks with your bank if there are sufficient funds available to carry the transaction and requests to put in on hold for an upcoming payment, and then capturing them which amounts to debiting your account.

{% hint style='info' %}

The biggest advantage of uncaptured charges is that you are guaranteed payment as the bank has confirmed availability of the funds, but you can also instantly release an uncaptured charge instead of waiting 3~5 days for a refund. Note that Stripe charges a fee for captured charges and refunds but releasing an uncaptured charge is free.

- A **customer** is the holder of one or multiple means of payment. 

- A **token**: this is essentially a representation of your credit card with its information encoded by Stripe using your public key. It can only be used once and will be disabled after payment is done.

- A **source** is another representation of your card that can generate recurring payments. It can only be generated by your secret key.

### What you need to get started

- Create your account on www.stripe.com. In the `Developer` tab, you will see two API keys: a public one for your frontend and a secret one for your backend.

{% hint style='info' %}

You can share your public key with confidence as it can only create card tokenss. On the other hand, the secret key will handle sensitive operations such as payment, refunds and so on. Store it securely in your server and avoid if possible committing it in versioned source code.

- A React Native mobile app

- A backend server. We will use Node in this example but bear in mind that Stripe supports a variety of widely used languages such as Python, PHP, Java and .NET.


### Preparing the backend

The idea is to expose a POST route that will handle payment on the server side
